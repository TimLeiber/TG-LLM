A set of candidate answers.\n\nProcess:\n- Step 1: Given only the question, select which external fact types (predicate) is relevant for answering it.\n- Step 2: You will then be given the same question again, along with candidate answers and the external facts you chose in predicate form.\n- Step 3: Use the selected predicate type and the provided facts to determine the correct answer.\n\nInstructions:\n- Each question can theoretically be answered using facts from a single predicate type, but you can decide to use more. Just try to minimize them.\n- Use only the provided facts; they are sufficient.\n- Your answers will have to be in JSON format. Do not include any text outside the JSON object.",
