    "question_prompt": "\nYou are given a story and a question. \nAnswer the question by selecting exactly one of the candidate answers.\n\nStory:\nOnce upon a time, in the charming town of Yorktown, a beautiful building called Oceanview stood tall and proud. It was owned by the town itself and served as a symbol of community and prosperity. Construction on Oceanview began in 1976, and it quickly became a cherished landmark. Just a year later, in 1977, a lovely girl named Emily Thompson was born in Yorktown. As she grew up, she always found herself drawn to the magnificent Oceanview Building. Its grandeur and elegance captivated her from a young age, and she often dreamed of one day having a connection to it. In 2007, Emily's dream came true when she married a kind-hearted man named James Davidson. Excitingly, James had a deep reverence for Oceanview as well. It was as if their shared admiration for the building was destiny bringing them together. The couple's happiness flourished, and over the next two years, they built a beautiful life together. Unfortunately, tragedy struck in 2009 when Emily, unexpectedly, passed away in Oceanview. The building that had held so much enchantment for her became her final resting place. Devastated by the loss, James was left heartbroken and filled with grief. The pain of losing Emily was unbearable for James, and in the wake of her passing, he sought solace in the memories they had shared. He reminisced about their marriage, the love they had shared, and the countless moments of happiness they had experienced together. James found comfort in knowing that Emily's final days had been spent in the place she had held so dear. In 2010, tragedy struck Oceanview once again, as James Davidson, weighed down by the ache in his heart for too long, took his own life within its walls. The building that had witnessed so much love, pain, and sorrow now held the spirits of two souls forever connected by their love for Emily Thompson and their shared affinity for Oceanview. Today, the Oceanview Building stands as a hauntingly beautiful testament to the intertwined lives of Emily Thompson and James Davidson. People passing by can't help but feel a sense of melancholy mixed with awe as they admire its striking facade. Some even claim to hear faint whispers of a lost love lingering within its halls, a bittersweet reminder of the love story that unfolded and ended within its walls.\n\nQuestion:\nWhich event started first, (Emily Thompson died in Oceanview) or (Yorktown owned Oceanview Building)?\n\nCandidates:\nEmily Thompson died in Oceanview\nYorktown owned Oceanview Building\n\nInstructions:\n- Use only the story to support your reasoning.\n- Select exactly one candidate answer.\n- The value of \"answer_choice\" must exactly match one of the candidate answers.\n- Return only JSON in the following format:\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<step-by-step explanation>\",\n  \"answer_choice\": \"<the candidate answer you selected>\"\n}\n",

Little did they know, their lives were destined to intertwine in ways they could never have imagined. Growing up in the same neighborhood, Ethan and Oliver were inseparable childhood friends. They shared countless adventures exploring the city streets, playing football at the local park, and dreaming of their futures. As the years went by, their friendship blossomed into something deeper, and they realized they were meant to be more than just friends. In the summer of 1996, Ethan and Oliver took the leap of faith and got married. Surrounded by their loved ones, they exchanged vows of lifelong commitment, promising to support and love each other in both good times and bad. Their love story became an inspiration to many, as they embraced their relationship with a kind of authenticity and fearlessness that touched the hearts of those around them. For three blissful years, Ethan and Oliver reveled in the joys of matrimony. Their love filled their home with warmth and laughter, and they built a life together, dreaming of a future filled with endless possibilities. However, life has its own plans, and their marriage came to an end in 1999. Though the love between them remained, circumstances pushed them in different directions, and they decided to part ways amicably. In the years that followed, both Ethan and Oliver continued their individual journeys, searching for happiness and fulfillment. It wasn't until 2005 that fate brought them back together when Oliver met a captivating soul named Sam Watson, who, coincidentally, was also born in Manchester in 1971. Sam and Oliver quickly fell head over heels in love, and their love story mirrored the intensity and passion Ethan and Oliver once shared. Ethan, ever supportive of Oliver's happiness, witnessed their union and accepted the changes life had bestowed upon them. He understood that sometimes, the paths we travel lead us to unexpected destinations, and that true love transcends time and circumstances. Ethan formed a deep bond with Sam and celebrated the love they all shared. But just as before, life had another twist in store. In 2013, after eight years of marriage, Sam and Oliver decided to part ways. The love that once burned fiercely between them had changed, and they both knew it was time to move on. Despite the dissolution of their marriage, they remained friends, cherishing the memories they built together and the growth they experienced during their time as partners. And so, as the story goes, Ethan, Oliver, and Sam continued their separate journeys, forever grateful for the love they had shared and the lessons they had learned.

In 2006, Mike got the opportunity to play for the Denver national under-20 basketball team. Representing his city on a national level filled him with pride, and he gave his all on the court. However, basketball wasn't the only sport that captured Mike's attention. In the same year, he also joined the C.F. Redmond football team. Balancing both sports was challenging, but Mike thrived on the field just as much as he did on the court. 2006 turned out to be a monumental year for Mike as he received an unexpected call from the Chicago Bulls. They invited him to join their team, giving him a chance to play in the prestigious NBA league. Mike's dreams were becoming a reality. But fate had other plans for him, and in 2007, he made the difficult decision to leave the Bulls and join the D.C. Mavericks. It was a change of scenery, but Mike embraced the challenge with determination and worked hard to make a name for himself. For the next few years, Mike continued to play for the Mavericks, proving his skills and dedication on the court. However, in 2009, he received an offer from R.N. Oakdale, a team he couldn't refuse. Mike embarked on a new chapter of his career, leaving D.C. behind. Although his time with R.N. Oakdale was short-lived, Mike made a lasting impression. In 2010, he transferred to the D.P. Northwood Juniors, where he showcased his versatility as a player. But basketball wasn't the only sport that captivated Mike. In 2013, he joined the Seattle United FC, immersing himself in the world of soccer. Simultaneously, he also played for R.T. Wolverhampton, splitting his time between the two teams. The following year, Mike bid farewell to Seattle United FC and signed with the Wexford City soccer team in 2015.

In the nearby town of Springfield, a girl named Alex Reynolds came into the world in 1909. She was a bright and spirited individual, with a passion for nature and a curiosity that knew no bounds. As fate would have it, their paths would cross, and their lives would become intertwined in the most unexpected way. It wasn't until 1942 that Oliver and Alex found themselves drawn to each other.

The next few years were filled with joy and laughter, as they explored the world together, supporting each other in their dreams and endeavors. However, their marriage sadly came to an end in 1947, as they realized that their paths had diverged, and it was best to part ways amicably.

Growing up, John had dreams of adventure and excitement beyond the boundaries of his small town. Meanwhile, in the neighboring town of Harrison, a baby girl named Sophia Johnson was also born in the year 1918. Sophia had a spirited personality and always sought to make the most out of life. As fate would have it, both John and Sophia eventually found themselves in the bustling city of Chicago by the year 1949. It was there that their paths crossed, and they fell deeply in love. In a small and intimate ceremony, John and Sophia exchanged vows and began their journey together as a married couple. However, their joy was short-lived, as Sophia's heart soon fell for another man named Colin Everett. In 1953, Sophia made the difficult decision to end her marriage with John and pursue her newfound love. John, though heartbroken, understood Sophia's feelings and agreed to the separation. Sophia and Colin embraced their life together, and for the next two years, they reveled in their shared adventures. However, their love story came to a tragic end in 1955 when Colin passed away in the serene coastal town of Oceanview. Overwhelmed with grief, Sophia felt a profound loneliness that seemed impossible to fill. In 1980, the city of Oakland became the final resting place for Sophia, as she peacefully bid farewell to the world. Her vibrant spirit had left an indelible mark on all those who knew her. In the years that followed, Braydon, the town where John had been born, underwent significant changes. In 1990, John became the proud owner of Lakeview Stadium, a beloved local landmark that brought joy and camaraderie to the community. For thirteen years, John poured his heart and soul into Lakeview Stadium, fostering a sense of unity and pride. But, in 2003, it was time for John to retire, and he sold the stadium, leaving behind a lasting legacy.

With her lively personality and a heart full of dreams, Hannah's infectious optimism brightened the lives of those around her. As fate would have it, their paths crossed when Benjamin and Hannah fell in love. They tied the knot in 1957, promising to support and cherish each other forever. Their love story seemed to be one of pure bliss, but life had its own plans. In 1966, Chris Johnson, a charismatic and ambitious individual, became associated with the Liberty Party in Boston. Chris was drawn to political discourse and believed in the power of positive change. Sadly, the bond between Benjamin and Hannah began to fracture, and by 1969, their once-solid marriage ended in separation. Life took its toll on their love, leaving both Benjamin and Hannah with a bittersweet taste of what once was.

She grew up in a loving family and had a spirited personality that captivated those around her. In another part of the country, Benjamin Richards came into the world in 1904, hailing from the vibrant city of Atlanta. Benjamin possessed a natural charm and was known for his ambition and intelligence. As time went on, fate brought Emily and Benjamin together. They became enamored with each other's company and decided to embark on the journey of marriage in 1924. Their union was filled with love, support, and countless adventures. Their happiness, however, came to a solemn end in 1932. Emily and Benjamin realized that their paths were meant to diverge, and they decided to part ways amicably. The two remained good friends as they ventured into separate chapters of their lives. In 1934, Benjamin Richards found love once again. He married the dazzling actress Olivia Griffin, and their romance thrived. The duo enjoyed a harmonious relationship, and their lives were filled with excitement and joy. Meanwhile, Emily Thompson moved forward and found love in the arms of a kind-hearted man named Noel Sullivan in the same year. Their marriage was marked by compassion and understanding, and they created a nurturing environment for each other. It seemed that love had a way of finding its course, as Noel and Emily walked a loving path together for a brief time. Soon, destiny had other plans for them, and they decided to part ways in 1937. Unbeknownst to them, Samantha Williams, a vibrant and vivacious woman, entered Noel's life in 1936. They shared a deep connection and decided to venture into marriage in 1937. Their love brought newfound happiness and purpose into their lives. As the years passed, Benjamin Richards faced his final journey, peacefully passing away in Greenwood in 1951. His legacy as a charismatic and accomplished individual continued to inspire those who knew him. Emily Thompson, a woman of strength and grace, bid her farewell in 1961, leaving behind cherished memories and a lasting impact on those who had the privilege of knowing her. Her presence would be forever missed, but her spirit would live on. Liam Thompson, Emily's younger brother who had always treasured her, also reached the end of his journey. He peacefully departed from this world in 1963, leaving behind a legacy of kindness and compassion. Samantha Williams, Noel's beloved wife, bid her farewell in 1967, leaving a void in his heart that could never be filled. Her vibrant personality and love had enriched his life, and her memory would forever be etched in his soul. Finally, Olivia Griffin, the dazzling actress and Benjamin Richards' beloved wife, breathed her last in 1986 in Harrisonville, Kentucky. Her artistry had touched the hearts of many, and her legacy would continue to shine through her timeless performances. And so, the lives of Emily Thompson, Benjamin Richards, Noel Sullivan, Liam Thompson, Samantha Williams, and Olivia Griffin intertwined, leaving behind a tapestry of love, separation, and enduring connections.

She grew up in a loving family and had a spirited personality that captivated those around her. In another part of the country, Benjamin Richards came into the world in 1904, hailing from the vibrant city of Atlanta. Benjamin possessed a natural charm and was known for his ambition and intelligence. As time went on, fate brought Emily and Benjamin together. They became enamored with each other's company and decided to embark on the journey of marriage in 1924. Their union was filled with love, support, and countless adventures. Their happiness, however, came to a solemn end in 1932. Emily and Benjamin realized that their paths were meant to diverge, and they decided to part ways amicably. The two remained good friends as they ventured into separate chapters of their lives. In 1934, Benjamin Richards found love once again. He married the dazzling actress Olivia Griffin, and their romance thrived. The duo enjoyed a harmonious relationship, and their lives were filled with excitement and joy. Meanwhile, Emily Thompson moved forward and found love in the arms of a kind-hearted man named Noel Sullivan in the same year. Their marriage was marked by compassion and understanding, and they created a nurturing environment for each other. It seemed that love had a way of finding its course, as Noel and Emily walked a loving path together for a brief time. Soon, destiny had other plans for them, and they decided to part ways in 1937. Unbeknownst to them, Samantha Williams, a vibrant and vivacious woman, entered Noel's life in 1936. They shared a deep connection and decided to venture into marriage in 1937. Their love brought newfound happiness and purpose into their lives. As the years passed, Benjamin Richards faced his final journey, peacefully passing away in Greenwood in 1951. His legacy as a charismatic and accomplished individual continued to inspire those who knew him. Emily Thompson, a woman of strength and grace, bid her farewell in 1961, leaving behind cherished memories and a lasting impact on those who had the privilege of knowing her. Her presence would be forever missed, but her spirit would live on. Liam Thompson, Emily's younger brother who had always treasured her, also reached the end of his journey. He peacefully departed from this world in 1963, leaving behind a legacy of kindness and compassion. Samantha Williams, Noel's beloved wife, bid her farewell in 1967, leaving a void in his heart that could never be filled.

Finally, Olivia Griffin, the dazzling actress and Benjamin Richards' beloved wife, breathed her last in 1986 in Harrisonville, Kentucky.

As fate would have it, Jaxon would go on to have a remarkable life, intertwined with the lives of two other individuals. In the neighboring city of Springfield, a young boy named Jake J. Bennett came into the world in 1951. Little did he know that his path would cross with Jaxon's in the years to come. Further down the line, in the peaceful town of Harmonyville, a girl named Sophia Clark was born in 1961. Little Sophia grew up with a sense of adventure and a knack for finding her way into unexpected situations. In 1964, destiny brought Jaxon and Sophia together, and they were joined in a loving marriage. Their lives were filled with joy and laughter, and they were fortunate enough to witness the birth of their only child. Meanwhile, Springfield underwent an exciting change when Moss Field came under its ownership in 1965. The sprawling sports facility became a hub of activity and brought the community closer together. However, fate took an unexpected turn in 1969, as Jaxon and Sophia decided to part ways. They bid each other farewell with heavy hearts, leaving their once-shared life behind. Not long after their separation, Sophia found solace in the arms of another man named Miles Gibson in 1975. They embarked on a new chapter, creating beautiful memories together. Meanwhile, Springfield made the difficult decision to relinquish ownership of Moss Field in the same year, leaving behind a legacy of thrilling sporting events. Surprisingly, destiny had other plans for Jaxon and Sophia, as they discovered their deep love for each other once again in 1986. They couldn't resist the undeniable pull and decided to give their relationship another chance. Their reunion was filled with joy and a newfound appreciation for each other. They made up for lost time and rekindled the flame that had once burned so brightly between them. Through the ups and downs of life, they remained steadfast in their commitment to one another. During this time, in 1973, Jake J. Bennett pursued his dreams of higher education and studied at Greenfield College.

As fate would have it, Jaxon would go on to have a remarkable life, intertwined with the lives of two other individuals. In the neighboring city of Springfield, a young boy named Jake J. Bennett came into the world in 1951. Little did he know that his path would cross with Jaxon's in the years to come. Further down the line, in the peaceful town of Harmonyville, a girl named Sophia Clark was born in 1961. Little Sophia grew up with a sense of adventure and a knack for finding her way into unexpected situations. In 1964, destiny brought Jaxon and Sophia together, and they were joined in a loving marriage. Their lives were filled with joy and laughter, and they were fortunate enough to witness the birth of their only child. Meanwhile, Springfield underwent an exciting change when Moss Field came under its ownership in 1965. The sprawling sports facility became a hub of activity and brought the community closer together. However, fate took an unexpected turn in 1969, as Jaxon and Sophia decided to part ways. They bid each other farewell with heavy hearts, leaving their once-shared life behind. Not long after their separation, Sophia found solace in the arms of another man named Miles Gibson in 1975. They embarked on a new chapter, creating beautiful memories together. Meanwhile, Springfield made the difficult decision to relinquish ownership of Moss Field in the same year, leaving behind a legacy of thrilling sporting events. Surprisingly, destiny had other plans for Jaxon and Sophia, as they discovered their deep love for each other once again in 1986. They couldn't resist the undeniable pull and decided to give their relationship another chance. Their reunion was filled with joy and a newfound appreciation for each other. They made up for lost time and rekindled the flame that had once burned so brightly between them. Through the ups and downs of life, they remained steadfast in their commitment to one another. During this time, in 1973, Jake J. Bennett pursued his dreams of higher education and studied at Greenfield College. He immersed himself in his studies, nurturing his passion for learning and personal growth. Fast forward to 2015, and fate weaved its intricate tapestry once again.

Meanwhile, in the neighboring town of Harrison, a baby girl named Sophia Johnson was also born in the year 1918. Sophia had a spirited personality and always sought to make the most out of life. As fate would have it, both John and Sophia eventually found themselves in the bustling city of Chicago by the year 1949. It was there that their paths crossed, and they fell deeply in love. In a small and intimate ceremony, John and Sophia exchanged vows and began their journey together as a married couple. However, their joy was short-lived, as Sophia's heart soon fell for another man named Colin Everett. In 1953, Sophia made the difficult decision to end her marriage with John and pursue her newfound love. John, though heartbroken, understood Sophia's feelings and agreed to the separation. Sophia and Colin embraced their life together, and for the next two years, they reveled in their shared adventures. However, their love story came to a tragic end in 1955 when Colin passed away in the serene coastal town of Oceanview. Overwhelmed with grief, Sophia felt a profound loneliness that seemed impossible to fill. In 1980, the city of Oakland became the final resting place for Sophia, as she peacefully bid farewell to the world. Her vibrant spirit had left an indelible mark on all those who knew her. In the years that followed, Braydon, the town where John had been born, underwent significant changes. In 1990, John became the proud owner of Lakeview Stadium, a beloved local landmark that brought joy and camaraderie to the community. For thirteen years, John poured his heart and soul into Lakeview Stadium, fostering a sense of unity and pride. But, in 2003, it was time for John to retire, and he sold the stadium, leaving behind a lasting legacy. And so, the story of John, Sophia, and Colin intertwines with the history of Braydon, Harrison, Chicago, Oceanview, and Oakland. Their lives encapsulate the beauty and complexity of love, loss, and the journey through time.\n\nQuestion:\nTrue or false: event (Braydon owned Lakeview Stadium) was longer in duration than event (Sophia Johnson was married to John Smith)?\n\nCandidates:\nTrue\nFalse\n\nInstructions:\n- Use only the story to support your reasoning.\n- Select exactly one candidate answer.\n- The value of \"answer_choice\" must exactly match one of the candidate answers.\n- Return only JSON in the following format:\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"<step-by-step explanation>\",\n  \"answer_choice\": \"<the candidate answer you selected>\"\n}\n",
    "response": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"To determine whether the event of Braydon owning Lakeview Stadium was longer in duration than the event of Sophia Johnson being married to John Smith, we need to analyze the timeline provided in the story. John and Sophia were married in 1949 and Sophia left John for Colin in 1953, which means their marriage lasted for 4 years (from 1949 to 1953). On the other hand, John became the owner of Lakeview Stadium in 1990 and continued to own it until he sold it in 2003, which means he owned the stadium for 13 years (from 1990 to 2003).
