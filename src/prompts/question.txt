Now, given the following base events and facts derived from your chosen predicate type:

Events:
$EVENTS

Facts:
$ASP_FACTS

Answer the question:
$QUESTION

by selecting exactly one of the following candidate answers:
$CANDIDATES

Here is an example:
Events:
event(person_a,born_in,town_x,1900,1,1900,1)
event(person_a,married_to,person_b,1925,6,1950,6)
event(person_a,died_in,city_y,1980,3,1980,3)

Facts:
ordering_on_start_years(event(person_a,born_in,town_x),1)
ordering_on_start_years(event(person_a,married_to,person_b),2)
ordering_on_start_years(event(person_a,died_in,city_y),3)

Question:
Which event is the third one in chronological order?

Candidates:
(Person A was born in Town X) starts
(Person A was married to Person B) starts
(Person A died in City Y) starts

Expected output:
{
  "reasoning": "The facts show that '(Person A died in City Y) starts' has index 3 in chronological order. Therefore, it is the third event.",
  "answer_choice": "(Person A died in City Y) starts"
}

Instructions:
- Use both the Events and Facts sections to support your reasoning.
- Clearly explain step by step how the facts lead to the chosen answer.
- Select exactly one candidate answer.
- IMPORTANT: The value of "answer_choice" **must exactly match, character for character, one of the candidate answers listed above.**
- Do NOT rephrase, shorten, add parentheses, or alter the candidate text in any way.
- If your output does not exactly match, it will be marked incorrect.
- Follow the required output format strictly.

Output format (strict):
{
  "reasoning": "<step-by-step explanation of how the facts lead to the answer>",
  "answer_choice": "<the candidate answer you selected>"
}
