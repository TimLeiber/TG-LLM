Story: Once upon a time in the vibrant city of Manchester, two individuals named Ethan Johnson and Oliver Harper were born in 1969. Little did they know, their lives were destined to intertwine in ways they could never have imagined.  Growing up in the same neighborhood, Ethan and Oliver were inseparable childhood friends. They shared countless adventures exploring the city streets, playing football at the local park, and dreaming of their futures. As the years went by, their friendship blossomed into something deeper, and they realized they were meant to be more than just friends.  In the summer of 1996, Ethan and Oliver took the leap of faith and got married. Surrounded by their loved ones, they exchanged vows of lifelong commitment, promising to support and love each other in both good times and bad. Their love story became an inspiration to many, as they embraced their relationship with a kind of authenticity and fearlessness that touched the hearts of those around them.  For three blissful years, Ethan and Oliver reveled in the joys of matrimony. Their love filled their home with warmth and laughter, and they built a life together, dreaming of a future filled with endless possibilities. However, life has its own plans, and their marriage came to an end in 1999. Though the love between them remained, circumstances pushed them in different directions, and they decided to part ways amicably.  In the years that followed, both Ethan and Oliver continued their individual journeys, searching for happiness and fulfillment. It wasn't until 2005 that fate brought them back together when Oliver met a captivating soul named Sam Watson, who, coincidentally, was also born in Manchester in 1971. Sam and Oliver quickly fell head over heels in love, and their love story mirrored the intensity and passion Ethan and Oliver once shared.  Ethan, ever supportive of Oliver's happiness, witnessed their union and accepted the changes life had bestowed upon them. He understood that sometimes, the paths we travel lead us to unexpected destinations, and that true love transcends time and circumstances. Ethan formed a deep bond with Sam and celebrated the love they all shared.  But just as before, life had another twist in store. In 2013, after eight years of marriage, Sam and Oliver decided to part ways. The love that once burned fiercely between them had changed, and they both knew it was time to move on. Despite the dissolution of their marriage, they remained friends, cherishing the memories they built together and the growth they experienced during their time as partners.  And so, as the story goes, Ethan, Oliver, and Sam continued their separate journeys, forever grateful for the love they had shared and the lessons they had learned.
